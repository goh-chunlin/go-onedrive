go-onedrive is a Golang client library for accessing the [Microsoft OneDrive REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/?view=odsp-graph-online).

This project is inspired by a few open-source projects, especially the [go-github project from Google](https://github.com/google/go-github).

Currently, **go-onedrive requires Golang version 1.15 or greater**.  go-onedrive tracks [Golang version support policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy). I'll do my best not to break older versions of Golang if I don't have to, but due to tooling constraints, I don't always test older versions.

## Installation ##

```bash
go get github.com/goh-chunlin/go-onedrive
```

## Usage ##

```go
import "github.com/goh-chunlin/go-onedrive/onedrive"
```

Construct a new OneDrive client, then use the various services on the client to access different parts of the OneDrive API. For example:

```go
ctx := context.Background()
ts := oauth2.StaticTokenSource(
	&oauth2.Token{AccessToken: "..."},
)
tc := oauth2.NewClient(ctx, ts)

client := onedrive.NewClient(tc)

// list all OneDrive drives for the current logged in user
drives, err := onedrive.Drives.List(ctx)
```

NOTE: Using the [context](https://godoc.org/context) package, one can easily pass cancelation signals and deadlines to various services of the client for handling a request. In case there is no context available, then `context.Background()` can be used as a starting point.

## Authentication ##

The go-onedrive library does not directly handle authentication. Instead, when creating a new client, pass an `http.Client` that can handle authentication for you. The easiest and recommended way to do this is using the [oauth2](https://github.com/golang/oauth2)
library.

Note that when using an authenticated Client, all calls made by the client will
include the specified OAuth token. Therefore, authenticated clients should
almost never be shared between different users.

See the [oauth2 docs](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/oauth2) for complete instructions on using that library.

## Contributing ##

This library is being initially developed as a library for my personal project as listed below.
- [Lunar.Music.Web](https://github.com/goh-chunlin/Lunar.Music.Web).

Hence, API methods will likely be implemented in the order that they are needed by my personal project. However, I still welcome you to contribute to this project to support the following features.

- [x] General
	- [x] Async job to track progress
    - [x] Search
- [x] Drives
	- [x] Get default drive
	- [x] Get individual drive
	- [x] List all available drives
- [x] Folders
    - [x] Create
	- [x] Copy
	- [x] Delete
	- [x] List children (items)
    - [x] Move
    - [x] Rename
- [x] Items
	- [x] Get individual item	
	- [x] Copy
	- [x] Delete
    - [x] Move
    - [x] Rename
	- [x] Create share link to the item
	- [x] List share links of the item
    - [x] Upload simple item size < 4MB
    - [x] Upload and then replace with item size < 4MB
